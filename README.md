# Financial Portfolio Optimization Project


## üéØ Project Objective

This project aims to create an optimized financial portfolio using mean-variance optimization principles. The portfolio's goal is to maximize returns while minimizing risk, adhering strictly to the given budget constraint of ‚Çπ10,00,000.

## üìÇ Data Sources

- **T1_data/Annual_P_L_1.csv**: Historical annual profit/loss data (Time period T1)
- **T1_data/price.csv**: Stock prices at period T1 (buying prices)
- **T2_data/price.csv**: Stock prices at period T2 (intermediate period for returns estimation)

---

## üöÄ **Project Methodology**

### **Step 1: Data Loading & Preprocessing**

- Loaded datasets using pandas.
- Aligned stocks by merging T1 and T2 data based on stock names.
- Filtered stocks with positive returns to ensure profitable investments.

## üìà Mean-Variance Portfolio Optimization

- **Objective**: Maximize returns and minimize risk (variance).
- **Constraints applied**:

| Constraint              | Value                     | Purpose                           |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Sum of weights          | 1 (fully invested)        | Utilize entire budget             |
| Minimum weight          | ‚â• 0%                      | Avoid short-selling               |
| Maximum weight per stock| ‚â§10% per stock            | Ensures diversification           |
| Portfolio return        | ‚â• 0                       | Avoid negative expected returns   |

## üìä Final Portfolio Performance

| Metric                      | Value                |
|-----------------------------|----------------------|
| Portfolio Cost (‚Çπ)          | 9,99,807.49          |
| Final Portfolio Value (‚Çπ)   | 13,06,990.31         |
| Portfolio Delta (‚Çπ)         | +3,07,182.82         |
| Percentage Gain (%)         | 30.72%               |
| Portfolio Performance Score | **100 (capped)**     |

**Calculation:**

- **Portfolio Delta (‚Çπ)** = Final Value - Cost = 13,06,990.31 - 9,99,807.49 = ‚Çπ3,07,182.82
- **Percentage Gain/Loss (%)** = (Delta / Cost) √ó 100 = (3,07,182.82/9,99,807.49) √ó 100 = **30.72%**
- **Portfolio Performance Score (PPS)** = Base Score (70) + Gain% = 70 + 30.72 = **100 (max capped)**
